 Hello, Iâ€™m **vikki** a 22 year old guy, you may know me as *heyvikki* on most social media platforms. Iâ€™m from Delhi, IndiaðŸ‡®ðŸ‡³ . 


I primarly do **web development(not a pro)*. I do it so I do not have to depend on others to run a website or websites at present and in future.

Iâ€™m a Linux enthusiast. I use a GNU+Linux distribution called **Debian Linux**. Yeah, Iâ€™m not an arch fanboi, I just love using the distro as it fits my needs. I also use a window manager called *i3* instead of using a desktop environment, not gonna change anytime because I have a beautiful workflow on it. I also use Windows(I love Gaming). And i use WSL2(Ubuntu) for work when in windows.

I can code in Golang, write bash scripts, write some amount of C/C++, and present try NextJS.

I use **VS Code** as my main editor. I also use it for various other reasons as its very extensive, having extensions support for different languages. I wonâ€™t hate you if youâ€™re a vim user btw, because I am one too.

I use github for projects stuff, while I use gitlab for my personal projects.

Iâ€™m a friendly guy once you get to know me. I follow by this simple principle: Iâ€™m nice to those who are nice to me.
