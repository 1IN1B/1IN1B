## Who am I?

I'm no one special. I'm yet another teenager from somewhere in the world who loves computers. My pronouns are **He/Him**. I'm a 22 years old full stack web developer from India. Programming is my hobby, which eventually became my passion. I mostly code in Python, JavaScript, Go, Bash & CSS. I love to build bots, websites, useless projects and apps! I am experienced with stuff like Vercel, Heroku, Google Cloud etc. 

I am a huge Linux and open source software fan.I use a GNU+Linux distribution called **Debian Linux**. Yeah, Iâ€™m not an arch fanboi, I just love using the distro as it fits my needs. I also use a window manager called *i3* instead of using a desktop environment, not gonna change anytime because I have a beautiful workflow on it. I also use Windows(I love Gaming). And i use WSL2(Ubuntu) for work when in windows. I also spend my time ricing my Linux. 


I love to read English literature & solving math problems XD. I contribute to open source projects when I'm not busy with my studies & assignments. I also maintain some open source projects on GitHub. I love solving maths, exploring physics and watching anime apart from playing with computers and coding.

BTW My name **vikki**, you may know me as *heyvikki* on most social media platforms. Iâ€™m from Delhi, IndiaðŸ‡®ðŸ‡³ . 


I primarly do **web development(not a pro)*. I do it so I do not have to depend on others to run a website or websites at present and in future.


I use **VS Code** as my main editor. I also use it for various other reasons as its very extensive, having extensions support for different languages. I wonâ€™t hate you if youâ€™re a vim user btw, because I am one too.

If you have any important queries to ask me, feel free to read my FAQ & join my telegram chat instead of just sending a hi.


I am always looking for new opportunities to collaborate with others, and I am always eager to learn new things. If you have any questions or suggestions, please do not hesitate to get in touch with me on email  **chadvikki[at]proton[dot]me** .
